## Overview

VoteX is a project aimed at facilitating a secure and efficient voting system. Leveraging technologies such as facial recognition and a user-friendly interface, it ensures that the voting process is both accessible and trustworthy.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Utilizes facial recognition to verify voter identity, preventing unauthorized access.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with Dart, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
- **Data Management**: Employs CSV files for efficient storage and management of voting data.

## Technologies Used

- **Dart**: For building the main application interface.
- **Python**: For implementing facial recognition and other backend functionalities.
- **CSV**: For data storage and management.
